I am just responsible for the [gameplay codes](https://github.com/ZxMapleLiu/minigamefps) (everything expect AI behavior trees and UI) and the animation of guns (still sh*tty)... Yes the model of guns are just from Call of Duty... We don't have any artists in the team, and everyone was at home due to COVID-19.No one had taught any gameplay coding in the university before. That's part of the reason why I made the [code notes from CS193u (in Chinese) before the course video released](https://www.zhihu.com/column/c_1402713024562696192) after my graduation.

I have to delete ~50 light sources and close 2/3 of the rain emiters to make it runnable to post it here.

Maps are not created by me, and I know they're from other public scene, the level teammate just put some random enemy in them...

We are asked to finish 3 different course projects in 4 weeks, so I didn't event play the maps until the last 4 days. I have so many regrets on this project.
